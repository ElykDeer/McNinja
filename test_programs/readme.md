# Test programs!

We need test programs to ensure that our stuff works.

We'll start simple and get more complex.

First program is helloworld; it calls a single extern function (printf) and has a single global variable.

At each step, we should make sure that the resultant bitcode we're generating is as close as possible to the bitcode actually being generated by llvm

## Current examples

Roughly in increasing complexity, these are the current examples:
1. helloworld
2. helloworld-while
3. helloworld-for

## Next examples

4. Something with variables
5. Something with multiple basic blocks and control flow
6. Something with arithmetic operations
7. Not sure yet
8. sqlite
